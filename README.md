### About Fusion Merge

**Fusion Merge** is an open-source puzzle game inspired by the classic [2048](https://play2048.co). Instead of merging numbers, you combine
atomic elements to create heavier ones, adding a scientific twist to the familiar sliding-tile gameplay.

I created this game as a fun side project to learn more about canvas rendering and game development. As a fan of 2048, I wanted to create
something similar but with a new twist. The game is built using SvelteKit and TypeScript.

### Credits

Inspired by [2048](https://play2048.co) by Gabriele Cirulli, Fusion Merge builds upon the original concept with a new theme. Thanks to
Gabriele for the inspiration and for making such a fun game! Reference to the original game can be found in
the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048).
