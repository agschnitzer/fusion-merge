    <p>
      <strong>Fusion Merge</strong> is an open-source puzzle game inspired by the classic
      <a href="https://play2048.co" target="_blank">2048</a>. Instead of merging numbers, you combine atomic
      elements to create heavier ones, adding a <strong>scientific twist</strong> to the familiar sliding-tile gameplay.
    </p>

    <p>
      I created this game as a fun side project to learn more about canvas rendering and game development. As a fan of 2048, I
      wanted to create something similar but with a new twist. The game is built using SvelteKit and TypeScript.
